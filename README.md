# MyToday
### Needed a simple todo list to help me manage basic tasks, so I decided to make my own.
---
The main goals for this project were to:
* Get an introductory to andorid studio's architecture components 
* Learn to make custom views
* Try a more strucured approach to my coding
* Have a small and easily manageable scope
* Use development methods learned at university

But really I just wanted to code something, and will continue to build upon this project.
